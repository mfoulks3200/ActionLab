An action-reaction toolkit for Unity

Actionlab is an addon that allows you to specify certain simple scripting events within a component, without the need for scripting. You can use ActionLab to trigger animations, get input from external devices, destroy components, and more. Please feel free to fork, or submit issues. You can check the [releases page](https://github.com/mfoulks3200/ActionLab/releases) for the most recent Unity Package.
